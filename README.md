#sturdy-robot is a simple tool to help EMS practitioners. To run the code on an android device you can do the following steps:

	1 - Download "termux"(A free and open source app.) from the google play store or f-droid.

	2 - Open "termux" and run "apt install git python2 nano" without quotations.

	3 - Again, with "termux" run "git clone https://github.com/ncoon/sturdy-robot" without quotations.

	4 - Now you can run the code! Simply change directories "cd sturdy-robot" followed by "python2 main.py".

#Alternatively you may download the code and run it without termux by using another python interpreter. This code should be operating system agnostic.

#Feel free to copy the project and add your own scripts, please contact me if you do so as I'd like to add them to sturdy-robot!
