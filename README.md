# sturdy-robot is a simple tool to help EMS practitioners. To get it working on mobile you will need to download a python interpreter then point the interpreter to the directory you've stored the .py files in. Alternatively place the .py files in the default directory that your python interpreter uses.

Feel free to copy the project and add your own scripts, please contact me if you do so as I'd like to add them to sturdy-robot!
